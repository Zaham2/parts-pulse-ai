# PCMarket - AI-Powered Used PC Components Marketplace

## Project Overview

PCMarket is an innovative e-commerce platform specifically designed for buying and selling used PC components. The platform's standout feature is its integration with external AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to provide intelligent component evaluation and pricing recommendations. Built with React and Supabase, it aims to create a trusted marketplace where sellers can get fair valuations and buyers can purchase quality-verified components.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18.3** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent, accessible UI elements
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state management

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Supabase** for backend services including:
  - PostgreSQL database for data persistence
  - Authentication system with role-based access (buyers/sellers)
  - Edge Functions for serverless API endpoints
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Storage buckets for product images

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI API** integration for component evaluation (currently using GPT-4o-mini)
- Extensible architecture to support Claude and Gemini integrations

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

## ðŸš§ Features In Progress / Not Yet Implemented

### 1. **AI Integration Completion**
While the foundation exists, several aspects need completion:
- **Real AI API Integration**: The current implementation uses mock data instead of actual AI responses in the frontend
- **Multiple AI Provider Support**: Only OpenAI is configured; Claude and Gemini integrations are pending
- **Image Analysis**: The AI currently doesn't process uploaded images for visual condition assessment
- **Market Data Integration**: No real-time market pricing data is being fetched for comparison
- **Confidence Score Calibration**: The AI confidence scoring system needs refinement

### 2. **E-Commerce Functionality**
Critical e-commerce features that need implementation:
- **Shopping Cart System**: No cart functionality exists yet
- **Checkout Process**: Payment integration is completely missing
- **Order Management**: While the database table exists, there's no order creation or tracking UI
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: No Stripe, PayPal, or other payment processors
- **Shipping Integration**: No shipping calculator or tracking system
- **Invoice Generation**: No billing or invoice system

### 3. **User Features**
Several user-facing features are missing:
- **User Profiles**: No public profile pages for sellers
- **Wishlist/Favorites**: The heart icon exists but doesn't persist favorites
- **Product Reviews & Ratings**: No review system despite rating display
- **Messaging System**: The dashboard shows a messages tab but no actual implementation
- **Email Notifications**: No transactional emails for orders, evaluations, etc.
- **Search History**: No saved searches or personalized recommendations

### 4. **Seller Tools**
Additional seller functionality needed:
- **Bulk Upload**: No CSV or bulk product import feature
- **Inventory Management**: Basic listing only, no stock tracking
- **Analytics Dashboard**: The analytics tab is just a placeholder
- **Promotional Tools**: No discount codes, sales, or featured listings
- **Seller Verification**: No KYC or verification process

### 5. **Security & Performance**
Important security and performance features missing:
- **Rate Limiting**: No API rate limiting on Edge Functions
- **Input Validation**: Limited frontend validation, backend validation needed
- **Image Optimization**: No automatic image resizing or compression
- **Caching Strategy**: No Redis or caching layer implementation
- **Error Logging**: No centralized error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Code Architecture**
The codebase would benefit from several architectural improvements:
- **State Management**: Consider implementing Redux or Zustand for complex state management beyond React Query
- **Component Organization**: Create a more modular component structure with atomic design principles
- **Type Safety**: Strengthen TypeScript usage with stricter configurations and better type definitions
- **API Layer**: Implement a proper API client layer with interceptors and standardized error handling
- **Testing**: No test files exist - implement unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests

### 2. **User Experience**
Several UX enhancements would improve the platform:
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton screens instead of simple spinners
- **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries for graceful error handling
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simplify complex forms with better information architecture
- **Accessibility**: Enhance ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Mobile Optimization**: While responsive, the mobile experience needs specific optimizations

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
Performance improvements to consider:
- **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for route components
- **Image Lazy Loading**: Use Intersection Observer for image loading
- **Bundle Optimization**: Analyze and reduce bundle size
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize database queries with proper indexes
- **CDN Integration**: Serve static assets through a CDN

### 4. **AI Enhancement**
The AI evaluation system could be significantly improved:
- **Computer Vision**: Implement actual image analysis for damage detection
- **Price History Tracking**: Build a database of historical pricing data
- **Market Trend Analysis**: Integrate with eBay, Amazon APIs for price comparison
- **Recommendation Engine**: Use AI for personalized product recommendations
- **Fraud Detection**: Implement AI-based fraud detection for listings

### 5. **Business Features**
Additional features for business growth:
- **Admin Dashboard**: No admin interface for platform management
- **Reporting System**: Financial and operational reporting tools
- **Commission System**: Automated commission calculation and payouts
- **Affiliate Program**: Referral tracking and rewards
- **API Documentation**: Public API for third-party integrations

## Database Migration
The project requires a Supabase project with the following tables configured:
- users (with RLS policies)
- products
- ai_evaluations
- orders

SQL migration scripts should be added to properly set up the database schema.

## Deployment Considerations

### Frontend Deployment
The application can be deployed to:
- Vercel (recommended for Next.js compatibility)
- Netlify (good for static sites)
- Cloudflare Pages (excellent performance)

### Edge Functions
Supabase Edge Functions need to be deployed separately:
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-evaluate-product
supabase functions deploy get-products
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase tables
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- CORS headers configured on Edge Functions

### Recommended Security Enhancements
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Implement CAPTCHA for registration
- Add SQL injection prevention on search queries
- Implement file upload validation and virus scanning
- Add two-factor authentication option
